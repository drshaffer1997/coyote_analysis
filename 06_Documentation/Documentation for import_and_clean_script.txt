Documentation for import_and_clean_data.R file
In this script, I import and do the first steps in cleaning GPS movement data for coyotes collared at the DeLuca Preserve in 2024. I filter the data and perform a preliminary check to only include data viable for analysis. First, I filter the data to include only GPS locations that with the minimum number of satellites to acquire an accurate fix and when a collar is deployed on a live coyote. I then produce diagnostic figures to check for outlier locations, which I save to the figures folder. I then save a clean_gps_data.csv file in the clean data folder.
